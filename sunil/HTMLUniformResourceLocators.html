    <p><h4>A URL is another word for a web address.

        A URL can be composed of words (e.g. w3schools.com), or an Internet Protocol (IP) address (e.g. 192.68.20.50).

3. URL encoding replaces non-ASCII characters with a "%" followed by hexadecimal digits.<br>

4. URLs cannot contain spaces. URL encoding normally replaces a space with a plus (+) sign, or %20
