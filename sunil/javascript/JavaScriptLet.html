    <h1>JavaScript Let</h1>
    <h3>The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)<br>

        Variables declared with let have Block Scope<br>
        
        Variables declared with let must be Declared before use<br>
        
        Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared in the same scope</h3><br>

        <h2>Block Scope
            Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript did not have Block Scope.<br>
            
            JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope.<br>
            
            ES6 introduced the two new JavaScript keywords: let and const.<br>
            
            These two keywords provided Block Scope in JavaScript:<br>
            <h1>const variable not accessed outside the block.</h1>
            <p id="demo">value is:-</p>
            
            <script>
               
                //const a=40; it is also not accessed by const also becos outside the braces({}).
            {
            const a=10;    
            
                <!-- this is inside the block  -->
                document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML=a;
                

        }   
    </script>
            <h1>var variable accessed outside the block.</h1>
            <p id="demo4"></p>
    <script>
                    var z=50;//we accessed var outside the braces.becos it it also called global scope declared.

        {
                var z=30;
                document.getElementById('demo4').innerHTML=z;
        }
    </script>
                <h1>let variable not accessed outside the block.</h1>

    <p id="demo5"></p>
    <script>
              //let x =20; it is not accessed by let. becos outside the braces({}).
        {
            let x=5; //this both variable declare inside the block mean inside the braces({}).
                document.getElementById('demo5').innerHTML=x;
        }

                    //var x=20;not alloed becos confilict problem to choose which value.var have both option to redeclare and reassign value.
                    //const x=10;never reassign and nor redeclare .
                    //let x=20; redeclare but we use another block and const also do same.
