    <h1>JavaScript Comments</h1>
    <h2>java scripts allow single line and multiline comments.</h2>
    <p>Single line comments start with //.<br>

    Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by 
    JavaScript (will not be executed).</p>
    <p>Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.<br>

        Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.<br>
        
        This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code</p>
    <h2>java use comments to prevent execution</h2>
